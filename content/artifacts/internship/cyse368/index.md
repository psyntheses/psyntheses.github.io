This is a reflection detailing my sixth and final 50 hours of working as an IT
technician under the context of the CYSE368 Cybersecurity Internship course. When
initially applying and training for this employment opportunity, I honestly was not expecting
the depth in which security is prioritized. I was pleasantly surprised by the heightened
significance of system and network security, especially considering the quick expansion of
this digital world. In these final hours, my focus primarily resided on secure configuration
of IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

As we progress further into a digital era, it becomes of increasing importance to
ensure that manufacturers sufficiently secure their products prior to distribution. IoT
devices can be virtually anything, from doorbell cameras to smart bidets. In the context of
my work, I handled devices such as desk phones, printers, and scanners. Unfortunately,
there are some clients who are unwilling or unable to upgrade to newer, more secure
equipment. In these instances, it is our job to properly identify and implement solutions
which allow the clients to operate as they please without introducing unnecessary security
concerns. This includes installing the latest patches and security updates on the
corresponding devices and isolating these devices from the main/secure network. This is a
cost-effective solution that still overall improves the clientâ€™s cybersecurity posture.

This has been one of my primary focuses during these last 50 hours. Unfortunately,
not every organization will be able to handle extra expenses relating to cybersecurity;
however, this experience has been incredibly educational for me. It taught me how to
engage with real-world clients and implement cost-effective solutions that align with their
budget. I also gained more hands-on experience with performing firmware updates on
various different IoT devices.
