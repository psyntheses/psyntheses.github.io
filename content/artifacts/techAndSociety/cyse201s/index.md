<h2 style="text-align:center">Cybersecurity and the Social Sciences</h2>

Students in CYSE201S explore and examine cybersecurity threats through an interdisciplinary lens. This involves the assessment of less technical aspects of cybersecurity such as the social, economic, political, and legal domains. A multi-disciplinary assessment enables students to identify the human-factor of cyber incidents, and understand the mechanisms that aim to control such behaviors. The learning outcomes for this course are as follows:

  - Compare and contrast how the theories and models of different social science disciplines explain cybersecurity
  - Identify any strengths and weaknesses that exist in a theoryâ€™s ability to explain the connections between human behavior and cybersecurity
  - Define key terms relating to cybersecurity such as cyber criminology, cyber law, digital forensics, cyber policy, cyber risk, and cyber threats
  - Identify how these interdisciplinary concepts are applied in a professional setting
  - Explain how to form strong hypotheses that address cybersecurity in an interdisciplinary respect
  - Describe how data collection, measurement, and analysis is performed in studies that address cybersecurity in an interdisciplinary respect
  - Explain how the societal understanding of cybersecurity has been strengthened by interdisciplinary research strategies

Course Material

Students in this course have completed a number of activities including a career professional paper, weekly technology and cybersecurity journal, several quizzes and exams, and the development of an ePortfolio.
